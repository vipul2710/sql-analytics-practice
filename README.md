# SQL Analytics Practice

This repository contains my SQL practice and projects, based on real datasets.  
I am using the **Online Retail II (e-commerce)** dataset from Kaggle, alongside exercises inspired by the book *Practical SQL*.  

## Structure
- `queries/` → SQL scripts organized by chapter/topic  
- `docs/` → Notes, explanations, and insights  

## Topics Covered
- Basic math & statistics with SQL (aggregations, median, mode, percentiles)  
- Joins and relational database design  
- Window functions & advanced analytics  
- Data cleaning and transformation  
- Building mini-analytical projects with SQL  

## Dataset
- **Online Retail II dataset** (Kaggle)  
- Contains transactions from a UK-based online retailer between 2009–2011  
- Columns: `InvoiceNo`, `StockCode`, `Description`, `Quantity`, `InvoiceDate`, `UnitPrice`, `CustomerID`, `Country`

## Goals
- Strengthen SQL for analytics and data engineering  
- Build portfolio-ready examples that map to real consulting work  
- Prepare for European DE/DA job interviews
